# Drupal Bash Ignitor

Bash script to ignite your drupal project.

## Overview
This script will install Drupal, enable several core modules, download and
enable several contrib modules, and clone and enable several custom modules,
features and themes. Basically, it automates the first four hours of work on
90% of the Drupal sites I build.

  ultimately want to install Drupal

  Insert module)

  input through Markdown)

* Pathauto pattern for nodes = `[node:title]`
* Default theme = `bootstrap_starter`
* Admin theme: `seven`
* Use admin theme for editing content = `TRUE`
* User cancel method = Delete account and set content author to Anonymous
* Allow users to create accounts = FALSE

## What about Install Profiles or Distributions?

I decided not to go with creating a Distribution for several reasons. Most
notably:

* ~~You need a full project on DO~~
* ~~You aren't allowed to include modules or themes that aren't full projects~~

(I know know these aren't valid! Should have used a distro!)

## Instructions

### Install

1. Place the `dbi.sh` in the parent directory of where you want to install
   Drupal. For example, if you want to install Drupal in
   `/var/www/vhost/mysite/public_html`, you should place and run this script in
   `var/www/vhosts/mysite`.

   You can use the following to download the script:

        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balsama/drupal-bash-ignitor/master/dbi.sh --no-check-certificate

2. From the same directory, run the following command:

        bash dbi.sh

3. The script will prompt you for the directory name (e.g. `public_html`), the
   databse name, and the database user and password.

4. Enjoy! The script takes about seven minutes to run, but will vary based on
   machine and your internet connection speed.

### Caveats

As I mentioned, this script is useful for 90% of **my** Drupal projects. Things
to note:

* Drush must be installed on your system.
* This will not work for multisite installs, or will only affect the "Default"
  site.
